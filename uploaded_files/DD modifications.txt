Some suggestions, many more to come :P

Comment 
- Comments are made by a user for a specific item. Modify the RS to include the concerned item.

Inventory 
- Owner is missing. 
- Change Item Tag to Item ID for clarity.
- Expand 'Details' (We'll have to discuss what to include in details).
- Field for image.

Current Transaction
- What does PK1 signify?
- I think we should add a field to describe which Offer is under transaction

Service
- Change Service Tag to Service ID for clarity
- Apart from Service Name, some other details might also be required
- What if we include Services int the inventory? So, the structure would be one table for items, one table for services and an inventory table to associate items/services to a user. Then we only need one Inventory ID to identify a service or item uniquely. This looks a bit cleaner to me. 

Put up for
- Why is there an Item Tag as well as Service Tag?
- What is PK1?
- Assuming that PK1 describes whether item is up for sale/rent/swap, the we can use just Inventory ID + PK1 as the fields (see the last point in Services).

Collection
- What is a collection?

Transaction Offer
- Where are the offer details? How can I determine what has been offered?
- Where is the item against which an offer has been made?
- This table should look something like (Target item ID, Offered item ID #1, #2, #3, #4, Cash). Buyer/seller can be determined from the item IDs.
